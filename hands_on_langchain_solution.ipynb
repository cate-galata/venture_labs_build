Many different business\\nconceptualizations exist; Osterwalder\\'s 2004 thesis[6] and co-authored 2010 book[1] propose a single\\nreference model based on the similarities of a wide range of business model conceptualizations. With his\\nbusiness model design template, an enterprise can easily describe its business model.\\nOsterwalder\\'s canvas has nine boxe s: customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer\\nrelationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure.[1]: 16â€“17 \\nDescriptions below are based largely on t he 2010 book Business Model Generation.[1]: 20â€“41 \\nInfrastructure\\nKey activities: The most important activities in executing a company\\'s value proposition.\\nAn example for Bic, the pen manufacturer, would be creating an efficient supply chain to\\ndrive down costs.\\nKey resources: The resources that are necessary to create value for the customer. They\\nare considered assets to a company that are needed to sustain and support the\\nbusiness. These resources could be human, financial, physical and intellectual.\\nPartner network: In order to optimize operations and reduce risks of a business model,\\norganizations usually cultivate buyer-supplier relationships so they can focus on their\\ncore activity. Complementary business alliances also can be considered through joint\\nventures or strategic alliances between competitors or non-competitors.\\nOffering\\nValue propositions: The collection of products and services a business offers to meet the\\nneeds of its customers.

The value proposition provides value through\\nvarious elements such as newness, performance, customization, \"getting the job done\",\\ndesign, brand/status, price, cost reduction, risk reduction, accessibility, and\\nconvenience/usability.\\nThe value propositions may be:\\nQuantitative â€“ price and efficiency\\nQualitative â€“ overall customer experience and outcome\\nCustomers\\nCustomer segments: To build an effective business model, a company must identify\\nwhich customers it tries to serve. Various sets of customers can be segmented based on\\ntheir different needs and attributes to ensure appropriate implementation of corporate\\nstrategy to meet the characteristics of selected groups of clients. The different types of\\ncustomer segments include:\\nMass market: There is no specific segmentation for a company that follows the mass\\nmarket element as the organization displays a wide view of potential clients: e.g. car.\\nNiche market: Customer segmentation based on specialized needs and\\ncharacteristics of its clients: e.g. Rolex.\\nSegmented: A company applies additional segmentation within existing customer\\nsegment. In the segmented situation, the business may further distinguish its clients\\nbased on gender, age, and/or income.\\nDiversify: A business serves multiple customer segments with different needs and\\ncharacteristics.\\nMulti-sided platform/market: For a smooth day-to-day business operation, some\\ncompanies will serve mutually dependent customer segments. A credit card company\\nwill provide services to credit card holders while simultaneously assisting merchants\\nwho accept those credit cards.\\nChannels: A company can deliver its value proposition to its targeted customers through\\ndifferent channels. Effective channels will distribute a company\\'s value proposition in\\nways that are fast, efficient and cost-effective. An organization can reach its clients\\nthrough its own channels (store front), partner channels (major distributors), or a\\ncombination of both.\\nCustomer relationships: To ensure the survival and success of any businesses,\\ncompanies must identify the type of relationship they want to create with their customer\\nsegments. That element should address three critical steps of a customer\\'s relationship:\\nHow the business will get new customers, how the business will keep customers\\npurchasing or using its services and how the business will grow its revenue from its\\ncurrent customers. Various forms of customer relationships include:\\nPersonal assistance: Assistance in a form of employee-customer interaction. Such\\nassistance is performed during sales and/or after sales.\\nDedicated personal assistance: The most intimate and hands-on personal\\nassistance in which a sales representative is assigned to handle all the needs and\\nquestions of a special set of clients.\\nSelf service: The type of relationship that translates from the indirect interaction\\nbetween the company and the clients. Here, an organization provides the tools\\nneeded for the customers to serve themselves easily and effectively.\\nAutomated services: A system similar to self-service but more personalized as it has\\nthe ability to identify individual customers and their preferences. An example of this\\nwould be Amazon.com making book suggestions based on the characteristics of\\nprevious book purchases.', metadata={'source': 'static/business_Model_Canvas.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

      "- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper, to taste\n",

      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F (200Â°C).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Remove the leaves and the tough stem from the cauliflower head, but keep it intact. Rinse and dry the cauliflower thoroughly.\n",

      "4. Place the cauliflower in a baking dish and brush the seasoned oil mixture all over the cauliflower, making sure to coat it evenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Roast the cauliflower in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until it is tender and golden brown on the outside. You can test its doneness by inserting a knife into the center; it should go through easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. While the cauliflower is roasting, prepare the gravy. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk continuously for about 2 minutes, until the flour is cooked and lightly browned.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Slowly pour in the vegetable broth, whisking constantly to avoid any lumps. Add the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce (if using), salt, and pepper. Bring the gravy to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, until it thickens. If needed, adjust the seasoning to taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Once the cauliflower is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.\n",
      "\n",
