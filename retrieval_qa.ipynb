It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to\\nsuppor t and manipulate speech. It involves processing natural langua ge datasets,\\nsuch as text corpora or speech corpora, using either rule-based or probabilistic (i.e.\\nstatistical and, most recently, neural network-based) machine learning approaches.\\nThe goal is a computer capable of \"unde rstanding\" the contents of documents,\\nincluding the contextual nuances of the langua ge within them. The technology can\\nthen accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well\\nas categorize and or ganize the documents themselves.\\nChallenges in natural langua ge processing frequently involve speech recognition,\\nnatural-langua ge unde rstanding, and natural-langua ge generation.\\nNatural langua ge processing has its roots in the 1950s . Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing\\nMachinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the\\ntime that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The propos ed test includes a task that\\ninvolves the automated interpretation and ge neration of  natural langua ge.'), Document(page_content='involves the automated interpretation and ge neration of  natural langua ge.\\nThe premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle\\'s Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules\\n(e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural langua ge unde rstanding\\n(or other NLP tasks) by a pplying those rules to the data it confronts.\\n1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian\\nsentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a\\nsolved problem.[1] However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which\\nfound that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was\\ndramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though\\nsome research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe[2]) until the late 1980s when the first\\nstatistical machine translation systems were developed.\\n1960s: Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were\\nSHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies,\\nand ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and\\n1966.
