      "- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves of garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons curry powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon cumin powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- 1 cup coconut milk\n",
      "- 1 cup chicken broth\n",
      "- Salt, to taste\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n",
      "- Rice or naan bread (for serving)\n",

      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent.\n",
      "2. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n",
      "3. Add the chicken pieces to the pan and cook until they are lightly browned on all sides.\n",
      "4. In a small bowl, mix together the curry powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and chili powder. Add this spice mixture to the pan and stir well to coat the chicken evenly.\n",
      "5. Pour in the coconut milk and chicken broth. Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a simmer.\n",
      "6. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the curry simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n",
